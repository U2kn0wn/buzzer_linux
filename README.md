# buzzer
this is a fun project to prank your friends

to make this work make sure your your friend have an linux system

this project will make a notification sound whenever a device is connected to your computer so, to make that happen first download master file to your computer/ friends computer then in the same folder download the sound file(I used hentai sound for this prank) and then name the sound file "sound.mp3"
then make the file executable by typing "chmod +x buzzer.py"
then download python3, pyduev and playsound
when all this is done type "nohup ./buzzer.py &" in the terminal now your prank is ready to go.
